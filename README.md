👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently pursuing a double degree in Bioengineering at the University of Padua and Electrical Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark. My academic path reflects a strong interest in robotics, brain-computer interfaces, perception systems and neurosciences.

🔭 I’m currently working on

Enhancing my skills in robotics and embedded systems, and exploring neurotechnologies through real-world projects in BCI and machine perception.

🌱 I’m currently learning

Advanced techniques in machine learning, neurorehabilitation techniques, robot perception, and control systems, with hands-on applications in autonomous systems.

💬 Ask me about

Robotics, brain-computer interfaces, MATLAB, Python, Computer Vision and my experiences studying abroad in Italy 🇮🇹 and Denmark 🇩🇰.

🚀 Pinned Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on recently:

🧠 BCI_development
Development of a 2-class Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface. This project focuses on EEG signal processing and classification methods for real-time neurofeedback via Unity game for the control of an upper limb exoskeleton.

👁️ Perception_project
It involves image processing, feature extraction, and object detection techniques for robotic vision.

🤖 Robocup
Developed in a team programs for running automatically a 4-wheels robot machine in order to compete in the danish Robocup 2025. Thanks to our strategy and its implementation we reached the final.

🎶 Fun Facts

I love sports (I play rugby since I was a child) and hiking!
